    2. You’ll get a token (e.g. 12345:6789ABCDEF) — just forward or copy-paste it to me.
  wrong_token: Doesn't look like anything to me. Please send me a token from your bot.
  error_add: Invalid token. Try to get a new one or use a token of another bot.
  bot_already_added: Looks familiar to me. You already have this bot connected.
